    <h3>
        File specification
    </h3>
    <p>
        A valid Othello AI consists of a Python file, version 3+, with a class called <code>Strategy</code> containing a method called <code>best_strategy</code> with the arguments <code>board, player, best_move, still_running</code> in that order.
        <code>best_move</code> and <code>still_running</code> are <code>multiprocessing.Value</code> objects.
        They can be accessed and modified by doing <code>best_move.value=34</code> or <code>print(still_running.value)</code>.
        The <code>still_running</code> variable will start as 1 but will change to 0 when your processing time is about to run out.
    </p>
    <p>
        You do not need to import the <code>multiprocessing</code> library to access these objects
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the method specification above, the <code>best_strategy</code> method can accept an additional parameter that would represent the time limit.
        In this case the method header would be <code>def best_strategy(self, board, player, best_move, still_running, time_limit)</code>.
        If you choose to include the additional parameter, an integer representing the amount of time allocated to your script will be passed to the function.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: The <code>best_strategy</code> method has to follow one of the above specification.
        Depending on the method header, the Othello server will choose the appropriate parameters to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
         Note: Your script will be automatically cut off regardless of whether or not your code uses the <code>still_running</code> parameter
    </p>
    <p>
        <span style="color: red">Warning: </span> All user code will be run in a daemonized <code>multiprocessing.Process</code>. This means your script
        cannot spawn any Processes of its own. If your code does spawn any <code>multiprocessing.Process</code> instances, it will error out.
    </p>
    <p>
        The board will be a length-64 string of characters from the set <code>{'.', 'x', 'o'}</code>.
        An <code>'.'</code> represents an empty space, <code>'x'</code> a black token, and <code>'o'</code> a white token.
        A valid move is with in the range 0-63, inclusive, and represents an index on the board string where the current player will place a piece.
    </p>
    <h5 style="text-decoration: underline">
        Scripts submitted before the 2020-21 school year are now invalid!
    </h5>
    <p>
        Students who submitted before the 2020-21 school year must now revise their code to recognize the 8x8 board(instead of the previous 10x10 board)
        and modify the set of characters to <code>{'.','x','o'}</code>(instead of the previous <code>{'.','@','o','?'}</code>) and resubmit their script.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Upload Errors
    </h3>
    <p>
        When uploading code to the server you may encounter one of the following errors.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            File has invalid syntax
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Othello server was unable to validate your code because there was a syntax error somewhere in the file.
                    Go back through your code and revise any syntax issues then upload again.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Cannot find attribute Strategy.best_strategy in file
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Your code does not follow the specifications listed above.
                    Reread the specifications and revise your code before submitting again.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Attribute Strategy.best_strategy has an invalid amount of parameters
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Your code does not follow the specifications listed above.
                    Specifically regarding the amount of parameters <code>Strategy.best_strategy</code> should take.
                    Reread the specifications and revise your code before submitting again.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Code takes too long to validate!
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Your file has some code that is outside a function or outside an "if __name__ == '__main__'" block.
                    Any code that is outside such block must terminate after {{ settings.IMPORT_TIMEOUT }}s.
                    Go back through your file and ensure that code that runs on import terminates quickly.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

        <b>
            If you encounter another error message that you cannot interpret, email <a href="mailto:{{ settings.DEVELOPER_EMAIL }}">{{ settings.DEVELOPER_EMAIL }}</a>
            a screenshot of the error message as well as your code.
        </b>
    </p>
    <h3>
        Logging
    </h3>
    <p>
        In addition to the specifications listed above, your <code>Strategy</code> class may contain a <code>logging</code> variable.
        This variable, if used, must be an attribute of the <code>Strategy</code> class.
        Therefore it should be defined within <code>Strategy</code>'s constructor (as <code>self.logging</code>) or inside the class but outside a class method (just <code>logging</code>).
        For instance, <code>logging</code> cannot be defined in the <code>best_strategy</code> method of your <code>Strategy</code> class or in a helper method defined outside of <code>Strategy</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If set to <code>True</code>, you will see the output of any <code>print</code> statements on either side of the board when playing your script.
        Output for scripts that are playing as black will appear on the left-hand side of the Othello board while the output for scripts that are playing as white will appear on the right-hand side of the Othello board.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you omit the <code>logging</code> variable in your <code>Strategy</code> class, it will be assumed that you do not wish to output any <code>print</code> statements.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span style="color: red">Warning:</span> If you set <code>logging = True</code> in your <code>Strategy</code> class, you will only be able to view your logging output only if you are currently logged in. If logged in, you will be able to see your logs whenever your script is being played, including if you are watching your script. Unauthenticated users and users who do not own the running script will not be able to view the logs.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Playing Games and Errors
    </h3>
    <p>
        To play a game, go to the <a href="{% url 'games:play' %}">Play</a> page and select two players.
        To watch a game, go to the <a href="{% url 'games:watch' %}">Watch</a> page and select one of the listed games.
        If there are no games currently being played, no games will be listed.
    </p>
    <p>
        When playing games, if your script behaves incorrectly, the server will interpret this as an <code>UserError</code>.
        When the server encounters an <code>UserError</code>, your script will automatically forfeit the game and your opponent will be awarded the win.
        The <code>UserError</code> will be reported in either log area, regardless if the playing script set the <code>logging</code> variable.
        The following are the possible <code>UserError</code> codes and their meanings:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            An error code of <code>-1</code> is a <code>NO_MOVE_ERROR</code>, meaning your script did not submit any move before the time limit
        </li>
        <li>
            An error code of <code>-2</code> is a <code>READ_INVALID</code> error, meaning your script submitted something to
            the <code>best_move</code> variable but it was not an integer in the range 0-63, inclusive.
        </li>
        <li>
            An error code of <code>-3</code> is an <code>INVALID_MOVE</code> error, meaning your script submitted an integer
            in the range 0-63, inclusive, but it was not a valid move given the current board state.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If any other error code is outputted, namely an error code within <code>{-4,-5,-6, -7, -8}</code>, this means the server has
        encountered an error while running your game. In this case, the game will be marked as a tie between both players, but
        you should email <a href="mailto:{{ settings.DEVELOPER_EMAIL }}">{{ settings.DEVELOPER_EMAIL }}</a> a screenshot of the game along with your code
        so we can investigate and fix this error.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, when running a non-tournament game, the server continuously checks if the browser which initiated the game is
        still watching the game. If not, the game will be terminated and the game will end in a tie. Meaning, if you start
        a game but then close the window with the game still running, the game will be terminated and end in a tie.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Example code
    </h3>
    <p>
        To get you started, here is the most basic form of AI, random choice:
    <pre>
        <code>
import random
import time

class Strategy:
    # implement all the required methods on your own
    logging = True # turns on logging
    def best_strategy(self, board, player, best_move, running):
        time.sleep(1)
        if running.value:
            best_move.value = random.choice(self.legal_moves(board, player))
            # Note: It is not required for your Strategy class to have a "legal_moves" method,
            # but you must determine legal moves yourself. The server will NOT accept invalid moves.
        </code>
    </pre>
    </p>
    <h3>
        Multiple files
    </h3>
    <p>
        You may submit code any amount of times, and the Othello server will record and store all your submissions. If you wish, you may retrieve any previously submitted script from the upload page.
        However, the Othello Server will only run your most recent submission.
    </p>
    <p>
        All your code submissions will persist on the Othello server, and you can retrieve previous submissions through the <a href="{% url 'games:upload' %}">Upload Page</a>. The Othello server will always
        use your most recent code submission when running your AI against other players. (If you were to submit twice, your second submission would be used to play against other users)
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: When uploading a script, you will be given an option to attach a "name" or "label" to that script.
        Adding a "name" to your script will make it easier to identify previous submissions if you wish to retrieve them later.
        If omitted, your script's "name" will default to the time it was submitted.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Running Multiple Files
    </h3>
    <p>
        As of now the Othello server will only run the most recently uploaded script.
        You should try to put all your code in a single file and upload that file.
        Any files created by your code will persist between runs and games.
        If you do in fact need other files for your code to work, and it is infeasible to include it in one file, contact <a href="mailto:{{ settings.DEVELOPER_EMAIL }}">{{ settings.DEVELOPER_EMAIL }}</a> or your AI teacher about your situation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span style="color: red">Warning:</span> When your code is uploaded, it is stored under a different, randomly-generated filename. Submitting two Python files and expecting to be able to import the other file by name is infeasible.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Replaying Past Games
    </h3>
    <p>
        After either <a href="{% url 'games:play' %}">Playing</a> or <a href="{% url 'games:watch' %}">Watching</a> a Game you may download a text-formatted version of the game using the "Download Game" button below the game board.
        You may choose to download the Game in a format that is pretty-printed and easy to interpret visually or in a format that is more easily parsed programmatically. The exact specifications for both formats, and a preview, are shown
        when downloading a Game.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to downloading Games, you can upload this file to the <a href="{% url 'games:replay' %}">Replay Page</a> and more closely interact with the downloaded game file.
        After uploading the game file, you will be able to step forward and step back through all the turns played in that game.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span style="color: red">Note:</span> Logging data is not saved in game files and will not be displayed during replays
    </p>
    <h3>
        Other Info
    </h3>
    <p>
        If your code fails to return a move, returns an invalid move, or errors for whatever reason, it will be treated as a forfeit.
        As such, make sure you code works on your computer before using this website to test against other AIs.
        Just as a reminder, if your code is caught cheating during the tournament in any way, you <b>will</b> be given an integrity violation, so just don't do it.
